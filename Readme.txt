WordPress countdown plugin for creating any custom countdowns, counters and timers.

== Description ==

WordPress countdown plugin 'Wow Countdowns' helps to create limited-time and limited-amount countdowns.

* Choose the increment interval for the amount-based countdowns. For example, set it to tick every 3 seconds, 1 second or a fraction of a second. It's up to you.
